# Notes

## January 10

Learned how to use github today. It is pretty simple. I will use `git clone` with the url to clone it onto my computer. Then, after I make changes or add files, I will use `git add` to add those files to be watched by git. Then, when I want to commit chnages, I use `git commit -m "message here"` and then `git push` to finish it all off.
